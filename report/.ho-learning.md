## Level 1: Memorize - Raw Information Extraction (20-30 minutes)

### What You Do

Scan the entire codebase WITHOUT trying to understand deeply. Just catalog what exists.

### Your Task

Create a comprehensive inventory of all contract components:

```markdown
## Contract Inventory:

### Core Contracts:
- VotingEscrow.sol - NFT-based voting power system
- MinterUpgradeable.sol - Token minting and rebase logic
- RewardsDistributor.sol - Reward distribution mechanism
- GenesisPoolManager.sol - Pre-TGE liquidity seeding
- BlackGovernor.sol - Governance implementation
- AutoVotingEscrowManager.sol - Automated voting system
- EpochController.sol - Epoch management for Chainlink automation

### Factory Contracts:
- GaugeFactoryCL.sol - Concentrated liquidity gauge factory
- PairFactory.sol - AMM pair creation
- VotingRewardsFactory.sol - Voting reward system

### Key State Variables:
- smNFTs (Supermassive NFTs)
- merkleRoot (reward distribution)
- circulatingBlack calculation
- topNPools configuration
- lockDuration (4 years max)
- rebase mechanism
- genesis pool states

### External Dependencies:
- @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable
- @cryptoalgebra/integral-*
- Chainlink automation
- ThenaFi base contracts

### Numbers/Constants:
- $28,000 audit bounty
- 116 smart contracts
- 10,108 lines of code
- May 28 - June 09, 2025 audit period
- 24 vulnerabilities found (2 HIGH, 22 MEDIUM)

### Identified Issues (from report):
- Incorrect circulatingBlack calculation
- Fixed reward amount for different tokens
- AVM token handling inconsistency
- Precision loss in smNFT bonus
- Unbounded loops in distributeAll()

[Continue cataloging EVERYTHING you see...]
```

### Common Mistake

Don't analyze yet! Just list everything - contract names, function names, modifiers, events, structs, libraries, comments about "SECURITY" or "TODO", weird patterns, complex math, external calls.

---

## Level 2: Try to Understand - Component Functionality (30-40 minutes)

### What You Do

For each cataloged item, explain what it does in plain English.

### Your Task

Transform technical components into understandable concepts:

## Understanding Each Component:

**VotingEscrow System:**
- What it does: Users lock BLACK tokens to get veNFTs
- How it works: Longer lock = more voting power
- smNFTs: "Supermassive" NFTs that burn BLACK tokens for permanent voting power
- Why it matters: Controls gauge weights and reward distribution

**Rebase Mechanism:**
- What it does: Adjusts token supply based on veNFT locks
- Formula: Uses circulatingBlack calculation
- Problem identified: Doesn't account for burned BLACK in smNFTs
- Impact: Incorrect rebase amounts

*Genesis Pools:**
- What it does: Pre-launch liquidity bootstrapping
- How: Projects deposit tokens before TGE
- Users contribute: Get yield-bearing LP tokens
- Risk: Centralized control over pool parameters

**Gauge System:**
- What it does: Directs emissions to liquidity pools
- Votes determine: Which pools get BLACK rewards
- Concentrated Liquidity: Uses Algebra DEX integration
- Issue found: Fixed 10e6 reward amount regardless of token decimals

**Auto Voting Manager (AVM):**
- What it does: Automates voting for passive users
- TopN strategy: Vote for highest TVL pools
- Problem: Inconsistent handling in RewardsDistributor

[Continue explaining each component...]

### Understanding Tests

- Can you explain veNFTs to your grandmother?
- Draw the flow of tokens through the system
- Explain why smNFTs burning BLACK matters for rebasing
- Describe the attack vector for the gauge reward issue

---

## Level 3: Rate Importance - Security Criticality Assessment (20 minutes)

### What You Do

Score each component/issue based on potential impact and likelihood.

### Your Task

Create a security-weighted ranking:

**10/10 - CRITICAL (Direct fund loss):**

- GenesisPoolManager.sol - Controls pre-launch liquidity
- MinterUpgradeable.calculate_rebase() - Affects all token holders
- GaugeFactoryCL reward calculation - Can drain protocol

**9/10 - VERY HIGH (Economic manipulation):**

- VotingEscrow smNFT logic - Permanent voting power
- RewardsDistributor claim paths - Direct reward access
- AutoVotingEscrowManager - Controls passive user votes

**8/10 - HIGH (System integrity):**

- EpochController - Chainlink automation dependency
- Upgrade mechanisms - Future vulnerability introduction
- Access control modifiers - Privilege escalation

**7/10 - SIGNIFICANT (User experience/fairness):**

- Lock duration calculations - User fund accessibility
- Merkle root updates - Reward distribution fairness
- Precision loss in calculations - Gradual value leak

**5/10 - MEDIUM (Operational):**

- View function gas limits - DoS potential
- Unbounded loops - Transaction failure
- Event emissions - Off-chain tracking

## Level 7: Connect Groups - System-Wide Attack Chains (30 minutes)

### What You Do

Map how vulnerabilities combine and cascade through the system.

### Your Task

Build comprehensive attack scenarios and defense strategies:

## Attack Chain Mapping

### Primary Attack Chain: Economic Manipulation

Step 1: Accumulate voting power
   ↓ (via cheap BLACK tokens)
Step 2: Vote for malicious gauge
   ↓ (using AVM inconsistency)
Step 3: Deploy high-decimal token
   ↓ (exploiting fixed reward amount)
Step 4: Drain rewards from gauge
   ↓ (massive decimal multiplication)
Step 5: Dump BLACK tokens
   = Protocol insolvency

### Compound Attack: Governance Takeover

Genesis Pool Manipulation
   + Vote Accumulation
   + Rebase Miscalculation
   = Control protocol emissions

### Cascading Failure Analysis

**Initial Vulnerability: smNFT Burn Not Counted**
   ↓
Causes: Incorrect circulatingBlack
   ↓
Leads to: Wrong rebase percentage
   ↓
Results in: Token supply inflation
   ↓
Triggers: Price depreciation
   ↓
Enables: Cheap voting power acquisition
   ↓
Facilitates: Governance attack
   ↓
Ultimate impact: Complete protocol compromise

## System Interaction Map

**VotingEscrow ←→ MinterUpgradeable:**

- Connection: BLACK burns affect rebase

## Key Insights from Deep Processing

1. **Simple bugs in complex systems = Maximum damage**
   - Decimal handling seems trivial but can drain protocols
   - One-character errors can invert entire security models

2. **Economic vulnerabilities > Technical vulnerabilities**
   - Vote manipulation affects all users
   - Rebase errors compound over time
   - Governance attacks are often terminal

3. **Integration points = Attack surfaces**
   - Every external call is a vulnerability vector
   - Cross-contract state must remain synchronized
   - Upgrade mechanisms introduce future risk

4. **Pattern recognition accelerates over time**
   - This framework becomes faster with practice
   - Vulnerabilities cluster in predictable areas
   - Mental models transfer across protocols

Remember: The goal isn't just finding bugs in Blackhole—it's building a systematic approach to security analysis that makes you exponentially better with each audit you perform.
